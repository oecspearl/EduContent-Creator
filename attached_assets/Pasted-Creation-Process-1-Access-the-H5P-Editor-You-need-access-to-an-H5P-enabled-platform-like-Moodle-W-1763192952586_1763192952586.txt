Creation Process
1. Access the H5P Editor
You need access to an H5P-enabled platform (like Moodle, WordPress with H5P plugin, Drupal, or the H5P standalone editor). You select "Interactive Book" as your content type.
2. Basic Structure
Interactive Books are organized into chapters and subchapters. You build the book page by page, with each page potentially containing multiple interactive elements.
3. Page Creation
For each page, you add a title and then insert content using a rich text editor along with interactive components.

Key Features
Navigation: Readers can use a table of contents to jump between chapters, and there's typically a progress indicator.
Responsiveness: Interactive Books automatically adapt to different screen sizes.
Tracking: When embedded in an LMS, they can track completion and scores from embedded questions.
Accessibility: Includes keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
The power of Interactive Books lies in combining these components - you might have a page with explanatory text, followed by an interactive video with embedded questions, then a drag-and-drop activity to reinforce learning, all within a single cohesive reading experience.
